# Flashcards

This project has a `flashcards.html` that contains the html and the javascript with React in the same file. CSS styles is split out into a separate file.
The app has two pages:
- Editor
   - can add flashcards (front & back of each card)
   - can delete flashcards
- Viewer
   - can go into a viewing mode of all your flashcards
   - toggle between the front & back of cards by clicking on the cards or using the "Flip Card" button
   - navigate to go to next or previous cards with the "Prev" and "Next" buttons

You can toggle between the Editor & the Viewer pages using the button at the bottom of each of their pages, "Go to Viewer" or "Go to Editor".
